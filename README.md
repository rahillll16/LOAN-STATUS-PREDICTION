# LOAN-STATUS-PREDICTION
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the approval status of a loan application. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, the app allows users to upload their own dataset or enter applicant details manually to get real-time loan status predictions with model confidence scores.
